The water system is based on rainwater harvesting and greywater treatment with a low-tech treatment implementing submerged, attached biofilm growth. Treated rainwater is used as drinking water and treated greywater is used for the washing machine and irrigation of the rooftop garden. In an experimental period of 17 weeks, several abiotic and biotic parameters were analyzed once per week before and after the rainwater and greywater treatment. Comparing the results to Swiss/EU regulation and literature, the treated greywater is suitable for irrigation and laundry. However, the treated rainwater did not always meet required microbial limit values, indicating insufficient performance of the LED-UV lamp. The greywater treatment unit achieved removal rates of 92% for COD and 98% for turbidity, and no accumulation of substances was observed in the treated greywater. Water self-sufficiency was at 100% over the whole experimental period, and excess water pumped out of the system met the standard for discharge into a water body. While these first results indicate a promising approach to the water concept, more long-term monitoring and testing with higher occupancy is needed."),

The aim of the present study was to assess the recovery of bioproducts (natural pigments and biogas) using cyanobacteria as tertiary treatment in a biorefinery approach. Secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was treated with wastewater-borne cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp. and Synechocystis sp.) in lab (3 L) and pilot scale (30 L) photobioreactors. Biomass was periodically harvested and pigments (phycobiliproteins) were extracted and quantified over time. Residual biomass was then used to produce biogas. For the first time, the presence of contaminants of emerging concern was analysed in secondary effluent, biomass and pigment extracts. Results showed how both cyanobacteria were able to remove up to 83% of N-NH4+ and 97% of P-PO43- from secondary effluent. The phycobiliprotein content was up to 214 mg gDW-1 for Synechococcus sp., while up to 222 NL CH4 kgVS−1 were yielded from residual biomass. For Synechocystis sp., a steady phycobiliprotein content around 70 mg gDW-1 was maintained over a period of 45 days at pilot scale (30 L). Only 3 out of the 20 contaminants of emerging concern detected in secondary effluent were found in pigment extracts.

In this regard, Granular Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (G-AnMBR) is a promising biotechnology that incorporates anaerobic digestion, granular sludge and membrane separation processes. The study revealed the ability of the G-AnMBR to meet excellent treatment performance and to increase the organic to methane conversion rate in comparison to a granular anaerobic digester (i.e. UASB), resulting in a positive net energy balance of 0.58 kWh produced per m3 of treated water. The supernatant fraction (dp < 0.125 mm) was identified as key driver in G-AnMBR fouling, in contrast to the granules (dp ≥ 0.125 mm) whose effect was negligible. Synergetic interactions between granules and supernatant compounds lead to a decrease in both fouling intensity and fouling rate, demonstrating the benefit of using granular biomass.

A higher exchange ratio was related to a slower increase in alpha over the aeration phase, while a higher temperature was related to a faster increase in alpha. Moreover, alpha was characterized by a same minimal value at the beginning of every aeration phase, which could be explained by the adsorption of soluble biodegradable organic carbon described by a Langmuir adsorption model.

Most AOB grow optimally at mesophilic temperatures, while thermophilic nitritation in natural and engineered ecosystems is mainly carried out by AOA. This may result in lower N2O emissions in AOA-dominated thermophilic nitrification compared to AOB-dominated counterparts. Nevertheless, no such information is available yet. We aim to unravel the N2O from thermophilic nitrification reactors for the first time. The reactors demonstrated stable full nitrification with an influent of 500 mg NH4+-N/L and loading rate of 0.5 g N/L/d.

Our research aimed to directly quantify methane and nitrous oxide emissions of open sludge lagoons of anaerobically-digested sludge using triplicate laboratory-scale sludge lagoon column incubations. Two different methane emission mitigation strategies were also trialled against an untreated control, whereby sources of nitrate (10 to 15 mg-N/L) and high nitrite (400 to 500 mg-N/L) were continuously applied to the sludge lagoon column natural water-layer. Methane emissions, primarily from ebullitive sources, were the dominant GHG emissions in the control and treated sludge columns. The cumulative methane emission as a percentage of the initial total COD was 23.5 ± 0.5 % in the untreated control after 29 months of incubation. This was reduced by approximately 5.3 % through the high nitrite dosed strategy despite excess nitrous oxide emissions. The nitrate dosed was unable to sufficiently penetrate the sludge-layer to achieve methane emissions reduction, highlighting a limitation that will guide future GHG mitigation strategies. Nitrous oxide emissions that coincided with temporal nitrite accumulation in the water-layer were observed and warrant further investigation.

Besides, low DO (0.2~0.4 mg/L) and low NO2--N concentration (~0.1 mg/L) also contributed to low N2O emissions from the system, with higher N2O production as a result of increased nitrifier denitrification pathway observed under higher DO or NO2- concentrations.

The proposed layouts consider varying levels of source separation (i.e., black, grey, yellow, brown, and, even, typical wastewater) using the corresponding toilet types (vacuum, urine-diverting, and conventional) and the necessary pipeline and pumping requirements. We show that the proposed layouts could satisfy 100% of the water demand in most of the scenarios (e.g., medium-sized buildings in wetter climates) while the worst scenario (i.e., high-rise building in arid climate) could satisfy up to 75% of the water demand.

Biocarriers-facilitated Gravity-driven Membrane Reactor for Decentralized Wastewater Treatment under Cold Climate.","This study investigated the effects of reactor configuration, operation temperature, and periodically cleaning protocol on the performance of biocarrier-facilitated gravity-driven membrane (GDM) reactors in treating municipal wastewater. The results indicated that (1) the cake layer fouling was predominant, regardless of reactor configuration and operation conditions; (2) decreasing operation temperature had negligible effect on fouling resistance distribution patterns and permeate quality; (3) in the presence of periodic cleaning (at 50°C), the cleaning effectiveness followed a sequence as ultrasonication-enhanced water flushing > two-phase flow cleaning > chemical-enhanced water flushing > water flushing, regardless of GDM operation temperature. Furthermore, the wastewater treatment costs of the GDM reactors were estimated at ~0.3 Euro/m3, which was lower than that of conventional membrane bioreactors under lower population scenarios"),

Freshwater microbial communities as a potential nature-based solution for wastewater tertiary treatment in small facilities.","The combination of micro and macro-scale experimental approaches focusing on the role of natural freshwater microbiota was assessed as a highly nature-based solution to be implemented in wastewater tertiary treatment in small facilities (<10,000 PE). Both experiments were focused to evaluate removal efficiencies of nutrients, fecal bacteria (E.coli) and contaminants of emerging concern. Additionally, we tested the contribution of natural inoculum affected by treated wastewater release to reduce economical costs in the upscaling process that under laboratory-controlled conditions performed irrelevant differences compared to non-inoculum effect. Previous results demonstrated high removal capacity on nutrients (over 65% in laboratory conditions versus 25-70% in a real scenario)."),
