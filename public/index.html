A higher exchange ratio was related to a slower increase in alpha over the aeration phase, while a higher temperature was related to a faster increase in alpha. Moreover, alpha was characterized by a same minimal value at the beginning of every aeration phase, which could be explained by the adsorption of soluble biodegradable organic carbon described by a Langmuir adsorption model. The dynamic behaviour of the alpha factor could be described by a decreasing exponential model as well as by a first order model..

To successfully remove ammonium from the spent brine, anammox and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were first cultivated in separate reactors under saline conditions (4.0%) and later combined in a single PN/A reactor. After continuous operation with sea water, the PN/A reactor treated recirculating brine from the IX column for 48 cycles of ammonium absorption and bioregeneration with minimal blowdown. The various cations of the regenerant solution were stable except for calcium that reached very high values upwards of 3,000 mg/L as Ca+2 and finally caused PN/A reactor failure due to mineral precipitation.

Systematic batch tests were designed and conducted to reveal the mechanisms of low N2O emissions from the process. In the PNA system, flocs were shown to be the major contributor for N2O emissions, while heterotrophic denitrifiers were the N2O sink. As a result of FNA side-stream treatment on flocs from PN/A tank, which was applied as a strategy to maintain PN, more resistance to NO2- shocks for flocs was found, especially under higher NO2--N concentrations, leading to a lower N2O emission factor (5.45% VS 15% at NO2--N 10 mg/L, compared with sludge without FNA treatment). Besides, low DO (0.2~0.4 mg/L) and low NO2--N concentration (~0.1 mg/L) also contributed to low N2O emissions from the system, with higher N2O production as a result of increased nitrifier denitrification pathway observed under higher DO or NO2- concentrations. The results of this work will provide guidance to the operation of mainstream PN/A process to minimize N2O emissions"),

The proposed layouts consider varying levels of source separation (i.e., black, grey, yellow, brown, and, even, typical wastewater) using the corresponding toilet types (vacuum, urine-diverting, and conventional) and the necessary pipeline and pumping requirements. We show that the proposed layouts could satisfy 100% of the water demand in most of the scenarios (e.g., medium-sized buildings in wetter climates) while the worst scenario (i.e., high-rise building in arid climate) could satisfy up to 75% of the water demand.
